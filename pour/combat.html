            <h2>The Combat in Dark Souls</h2>
            <p>The combat in Dark Souls can be sepperated into 3 categories: Melee, Ranged and Magic.</p>
            <p>Melee is your standard close combat weapons, like swords, maces, axes and shields. It is the most varied
                group due to the many movesets the different weapons have.</p>
            <p>Ranged is the smallest of the groups and is more used as an utility to try and get only one enemy from a
                group to attack you. The weapons are bow, greatbows and crossbows.</p>
            <p>Magic is consists of 3, allthough some might say 4, types of magic: Pyromancies, Miracles, Sorceries.
                Each type of magic has its own positives and negatives. Pyromancies can be used by all characters, but
                have a short range. Miracles are really good as utility spells, but are kind of weak when it comes to
                damage. Sorceries can do a lot of damage, but most of the good spells are only available in the later
                parts of the game. Both Miracles and Sorceries also require a lot of stat investment in either
                Intelligence of Faith.</p>
